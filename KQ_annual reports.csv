The Responsibilities of the Board 
The Board is clear on its role, powers, duties and functions. The Board has ensured the development of a Board Manual 
which contains a Board Charter, and which, having been last reviewed in 2019, is currently undergoing further review. 
The Board Charter has been disclosed on the Company's website as required by the Code. The Board is also guided by a 
number of policies including a Code of Business Conduct, a Directors' Code of Conduct, a Conflict of Interest and Gifts 
Policy, Insider Trading Policy, Board Induction and Development Policy, Dispute Resolution Policy, Board Diversity 
Policy, Board Appointment Procedures as well as a Stakeholder Management Policy, which are all contained in the Board 
Manual. 

The Board develops and annually approves its Work Plan, which enables it to have a balanced view of the business and 
to be sufficiently forward looking, with approximately 60% of its time being spent on matters that help it shape the future. 
The Work Plan also enables the Board to plan its activities in advance and to ensure that its Board meetings are planned 
and executed in an effective manner. Besides Board and Committee meetings, the Work Plan sets out other Board 
activities including Board Evaluation, Board retreats and training as well as investor briefings. The Board's Work Plan is 
approved before the commencement of the financial year to which it relates. The agenda for Board meetings is derived 
from the Board Work Plan. 

The full Board plans quarterly meetings in order to conduct its affairs. However, when need arises, the Board also holds 
special meetings to fulfill its mandate and to guide the Management as appropriate. The directors receive all relevant 
information for the discharge of their obligations in an accurate, timely and clear form so that they can guide and maintain 
full and effective control over strategic, financial, operational and compliance issues. 
Board appointment, composition and succession planning 
As a result of the current shareholding structure, ten out of the eleven members of the Board are non-executive directors. 
Four out of those ten directors are independent, including the Chairman of the Board. 

The Board considers that collectively, the directors have the range of skills, knowledge and experience necessary to direct 
the Company. In this regard, the Board has developed a detailed skills matrix that guides it in recommending directors 
for appointment. The Board's skills matrix is aligned to the Company's strategy and provides guidance for diversity in 
knowledge and experience, governance and industry skills, personal attributes as well as non-skills considerations such 
as gender and age. The skills matrix is used in conjunction with the Board Appointment Procedures and Board Diversity 
Policy which are published on the Company's website. Nominations to the Board are handled by the Corporate 
Governance and Nominations Committee, which vets all potential directors before recommending them to the Board for 
appointment. The Board then makes recommendations to the Shareholders at the Annual General Meeting. 
Non- executive board members are appointed for an initial term of three years. The Board implements term limits in line 
with the Articles of Association, the Board Charter and the Board rotation schedule. In this regard, the independent 
nonexecutive directors serve for a maximum of three terms of three years each. Re-appointment to the Board for a further 
tem is dependent on good performance, with the Corporate Governance and Nominations Committee assessing the 
director's performance and fit on the Board. 

Each director has a detailed letter of appointment setting out the terms and conditions of service including their fiduciary 
duties. The Chairman has a specific letter of appointment as Chairman of the Board. Each director has accepted their 
appointment in writing. 

The Board manages its succession planning with the assistance of the Corporate Govemance and Nominations Committee. 
The Committee has put in place a succession plan for the Board and in line with the skills matrix, reviews existing and 
desired competencies and guides the Board and shareholders accordingly whenever appointments are to be made. All 
except the Group Managing Director are subject to rotation in accordance with the Company's Articles of Association, 
the Code, as well as the Board's Rotation Policy. In this regard, three directors will retire by rotation at the Annual Genera] 
Meeting.

Notes: 
l . One third of the number of directors (other than executive directors) are required to retire by rotation in each year. 
2. The directors to retire in every year shall be those who (i) have been appointed by the Board since the previous 
annual general meeting in accordance with Article 67, (ii) being subject to retirement by rotation, have been the 
longest in office since their election or appointment, but as between persons who became or were last re-elected 
directors on the same day those to retire shall (unless they otherwise agree among themselves) be determined 
by lot. 
During the year under review, Ms Caroline Armstrong, Mr. JozefVeenstra and Mr. Solomon Kitungu were re-appointed 
to the Board at the Annual General Meeting of the Company held on 26 th June 2020. The three directors were vetted by 
the Corporate Governance and Nominations Committee and in line with the Board Appointment Procedures, the Board 
Diversity Policy and the Skills Matrix, were recommended by the Board to the shareholders and were duly elected to the 
Board unanimously. 

The Board has approved a succession plan for senior management. The Human Resource Committee is responsible for 
ensuring that the succession plan is reviewed regularly and that the necessary interventions are in place to ensure that the 
Company is not exposed to the risks that come with gaps in the organizational structure. 

Board induction and continuous skills development 
Upon appointment, directors undergo a detailed, rigorous and formal induction programme in line with the Company's 
Board Charter and the Board Induction and Development Policy. The aim of the induction programme is to enable the 
new director to become effective in their new role as quickly as possible. The new director is therefore provided with 
pertinent information to help them understand the Company and their role. The new director is also required to experience

firsthand the key operations of the Company and a detailed walk about programme is prepared for this purpose. New 
directors also meet senior Management, the Company Secretary and the Chairman of the Board before their first Board 
meeting. New directors are also provided with an appointment letter setting out pertinent matters relating to their 
appointment as a director and receive among others, copies of the Company's Articles of Association, the Board work 
plan, the Board Charter and relevant Board Policies. 
Board induction and continuous skills development (Continued) 

The Corporate Governance and Nominations Committee considers and recommends Board development programmes 
to ensure that the Board is kept up-skilled. During the year under review however, given the impact of Covid- 1 9, no 
Board development was undertaken. It is expected that Board members will undergo Board development in 2021. 
Code of Business Conduct & Ethics 
The Company is committed to the highest standards of integrity, behaviour and ethics in dealing with all its stakeholders. 
A formal Code of Business Conduct and Ethics has been approved by the Board and is fully implemented to guide the 
Board, Management, employees and stakeholders on acceptable behaviour in conducting business. All Board members 
and employees of the Airline are expected to avoid activities and financial interests that could undermine their 
responsibilities to the airline. The Board has approved a Conflict of Interest and Gifts Policy as well as a Code of Conduct 
specific to the Board. Directors are required to declare any conflict of interests upon appointment. In addition, a Director 
with an actual or potential conflict of interest in relation to a matter before the Board is required to disclose such interest 
and to recuse himself or herself from the discussions relating to the matter in question. In this regard, declaration of 
conflict of interest is a standing agenda item during Board and Committee meetings. In addition, Board members are 
required on an annual basis to make a declaration of any conflict of interest. 
The Company has a strict insider trading policy to which the Directors and Senior Management must adhere. The Board 
is not aware of any insider dealings during the period under review. All related party transactions have been considered 
by the Audit and Risk Committee and have been disclosed in the Company's audited financial statements.

and discuss potential ways of closing those gaps. 
Governance audit

selfassessment as required by the Capital Markets Authority. 
Transparency and disclosure 
The Company is committed to ensuring that shareholders and other stakeholders are provided with full, accurate and 
timely information about its performance. This is achieved by the distribution of the Company's Annual Report, the 
publication of half year and full year results in the press and on the Company's website. These are also released to the 
securities markets and capital markets authorities. There are also two investor briefings per annum for institutional 
investors.

price sensitive information. In this regard, the Company also complies with the continuing listing obligations of the 
Capital Markets Authorities and Securities Exchanges applicable in Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania. The Annual Report is 
published each year on the Company's website together with the notice of the Annual General Meeting.

SUMMARY AUDITED GROUP RESULTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2021

COMMENTARY
On behalf of the Board of Directors, I am glad to present the Kenya Airways PLC financial results for the financial year ended 31 
December 2021.
Following the worst year on record for the aviation industry, the industry is seeing strong signs of recovery particularly in US 
domestic travel and more moderate recovery in international travel. Kenya Airways took advantage of the lockdown period to 
restructure and transform our operations and products. We have seen some good recovery in our domestic, regional and selected 
international routes. We continued with our efforts to improve our flexibility and service offering to customers.
During 2021, KQ still felt the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic due to some restrictions and limitations due to the advent of the 
Omicron variant, particularly affecting our Dubai and Guangzhou routes but little impact in the European, US and regional routes. 
This resumption in operations increased the airline’s capacity by 11.5% over 2020 but remained 65% below the 2019 pre-pandemic 
levels. 
Even with all these challenges, Kenya Airways has weathered the storm to post significantly improved results. An incredible amount 
of work by the Board and management has gone into these results. Management sought alternative revenue streams to replace lost 
revenue because of various travel restrictions. These revenue sources included air charter services, which increased by 300% and 
ancillary revenues which increased by 65%. In addition, management have reduced costs by 3.5% and reducing lease rentals for the 
aircraft by Kshs 10 billion.
Capacity Deployment
Capacity deployed, measured in Available Seat Kilometres (ASKs) stood at 5,900 million compared to 5,292 million reported in 
2020, an increase of 11.5% and achieved a cabin factor of 60.8% compared to 65.3% in the previous year 2020. This was due to an 
increase in the number of routes operated compared to the previous year.
Revenues:
The Group’s total revenue during the year increased by 33% to Kshs. 70,221 million which is a laudable achievement and would 
have been higher had we not been restricted in the fourth quarter due to the Omicron variant as mentioned above and the ban 
on flights into the UAE during this time.
The Group uplifted a total of 2.2 million passengers during the year, a 25% increase compared to the prior year, but 57% lower than 
2019. The cargo business uplifted 63,726 tonnes, recording an improvement of 29% over 2020.  
Costs:
The Group saw a decrease of 3.6% in total operating costs for the year with direct operating costs increasing by 32.9% mainly driven 
by increased operations coupled with increase in global fuel prices throughout the year. Fixed costs declined by 26.7% driven by a 
strong emphasis on reducing both fleet ownership costs and overheads. 
Based on the above revenue and cost dynamics, the Group recorded a significantly improved performance, reporting an operating 
loss of KSh 6.8 billion compared to 2020 operating loss of KSh 27.1 billion (an Operating Loss Margin of 9.6% compared to 51% in 
the same period last year). This is a testament to the tremendous work that the management is doing to improve revenue, contain 
costs and conserve cash.
Overall, Kenya Airways Management and staff made tremendous efforts in 2021 to improve our service levels, improve revenues and 
focus on cost reductions despite the challenges brought about by reduced salaries and the reduction in routes flown.
Outlook:
Notwithstanding the current global crisis brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic and now the uncertainties and insecurities 
brought on by the war in Ukraine, Kenya Airways will continue its efforts to fly a more efficient network, improve service quality 
and delivery and further reduce costs. We will continue to seek our new partnerships and improve existing partnerships to offer a 
better product to our customers and improve our revenue opportunities.
There are several strategy initiatives that the company is pursuing that should help to future proof the various reform efforts that 
the company has instituted. Some of these include the commercialization of unmanned aircraft technology and eVtol, expansion of 
cargo and our MRO facility.
On behalf of the Board of Directors, I take this opportunity to express my sincere appreciation to our customers, the Government 
of Kenya, shareholders, financiers, lessors, the management, staff, suppliers, and other stakeholders for their continued support.

standards of corporate governance for the long term sustainability of the Company. 
The Board is responsible for providing the strategic direction to the Company, for formulating policies that support 
the delivery of the strategy and for ensuring that the Board and the Company as a whole has embraced good 
corporate governance practices in its structure, policies and operations. The Board oversees the operations of 
management, exercises control and remains accountable through effective leadership, enterprise, integrity and good 
judgment. In this regard, the Board is committed to fostering a culture that values ethical behaviour, integrity and 
respect and the need to conduct the business and operations of the Airline and the Group in accordance with 
generally accepted corporate practices and in particular, with the Code of Corporate Governance for Issuers of 
Securities in Kenya (""the Code""). 
Board of Directors 
The Articles of Association of the Company vests the governance of the Company in the Board of Directors. The Board 
is composed of eleven Directors as set out below: 
Mr. Michael Joseph Independent Non-Executive Director 
 (Chairman) 
Mr Sebastian Mikosz Group Managing Director & CEO 
Mr Jozef Veenstra Non-Executive Director 
Dr. Kamau Thugge Non-Executive Director 
Prof. Paul M. Maringa Non-Executive Director 
Mrs Esther Koimett Non-Executive Director 
Ms Carol Musyoka Non-Executive Director

Ms Caroline Armstrong Independent Non-Executive Director 
Major Gen (Rtd) Michael Gichangi Independent Non-Executive Director 
Mr Festus King' ori Alternate to Dr. Kamau Thugge 
Mr. Nicholas Bodo Alternate to Prof. Paul M. Maringa 
The Board takes its responsibilities seriously and clearly understands its role, powers, duties and functions. In the 
performance of its role, the Board is guided by a Board Charter, which was last reviewed in November 2018. The 
Board Charter has been disclosed on the Company's website as required by the Code. The Board is also guided by a 
number of policies including a Code of Business Conduct, a Directors' Code of Conduct, a Conflict of Interest and 
Gifts Policy, Insider Trading Policy, Board Induction and Development Policy, Dispute Resolution Policy, Board 
Diversity Policy, Board Appointment Procedures as well as a Stakeholder Management Policy. 
The Board annually approves its Work Plan, which enables it to have a balanced view of the business and to be 
sufficiently forward looking. The Work plan also enables the Board to plan its activities in advance and to ensure that 
its Board meetings are planned and executed in an effective manner. Besides Board and Committee meetings, the 
Work Plan sets out other Board activities including Board Evaluation, Board retreats and training as well as investor 
briefings. The Board's Work Plan is approved before the commencement of the financial year to which it relates.

There is a clear separation of roles between the Board and Management, and this separation has been clearly stipulated 
in the Board Charter. The role of the Chairman of the Board is separate from that of the Group Managing Director and 
Chief Executive Officer, and in line with good governance practice, the Board has delegated authority for the conduct 
of day-to-day business to the Group Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer. This delegation has been clearly

Board appointment, composition and succession planning 
As a result of the current shareholding structure, ten out of the eleven members of the Board are Non-Executive 
Directors. Four out of the remaining ten Directors are Independent, including the Chairman of the Board. 
The Board considers that collectively, the Directors have the range of skills, knowledge and experience necessary to 
direct the Company. In this regard, the Board has developed a detailed skills matrix that guides it in recommending 
directors for appointment. The Board's skills matrix is aligned to the Company's strategy and provides guidance for 
diversity in knowledge and experience, governance and industry skills, personal attributes as well as non-skills 
considerations such as gender and age. The skills matrix is used in conjunction with the Board Appointment 
Procedures and Board Diversity Policy which are published on the Company's website. 
Non- Executive Board members are appointed for an initial term of three years and the Board implements term limits 
in line with the Articles of Association, the Board Charter and the Board rotation schedule. In this regard, the 
Independent Non-Executive Directors serve for a maximum of three terms of three years each. Re-appointment to the 
Board for a further term is dependent on good performance. Each Director has a detailed letter of appointment setting 
out the terms and conditions of service including their fiduciary duties. Each Director has accepted their appointment 
in writing. 
The Board manages its succession planning with the assistance of the Corporate Governance and Nominations 
Committee. The Committee has put in place a succession plan for the Board and in line with the skills matrix, 
reviews existing and desired competencies and guides the Board and shareholders accordingly whenever 
appointments are to be made. All except the Group Managing Director are subject to rotation in accordance with the 
Company's Articles of Association, the Code, as well as the Board's Rotation Policy. In this regard, three Directors 
will retire by rotation at the Annual General Meeting.

with pertinent information to help them understand the Company and their role. The new Director is also required to 
experience firsthand the key operations of the Company and a detailed walk about programme is prepared for this 
purpose. New Directors also meet senior Management, the Company Secretary and the Chairman of the Board 
before their first Board meeting. New Directors are also provided with an appointment letter setting out pertinent 
matters relating to their appointment as a Director and receive among others, copies of the Company's Articles of 
Association, the Board work plan, the Board Charter and relevant Board Policies. The Board induction programme 
conducted during the year lasted three full days.

potential conflict of interest in relation to a matter before the Board is required to disclose such interest and, recuse 
himself or herself from the discussions relating to the matter in question. In this regard, declaration of conflict of 
interest is a standing agenda item during Board and Committee meetings. In addition, Board members have an 
annual declaration of conflict of interest.

Board is not aware of any insider dealings during the period under review. All related party transactions have been 
considered by the Audit and Risk Committee and have been disclosed in the Company's audited financial statements. 
It is also expected that all Directors will exercise independent judgment and shall act in the best interest of the 
Company. In addition, during the annual Board Evaluation, the Board assesses the independence of the Independent 
Non-Executive Directors using a tool approved by the Board. During the year under review, the Board assessed the
